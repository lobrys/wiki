# Spring Security Support Policy

Spring Security follows the https://tanzu.vmware.com/support/oss[VMWare Tanzu OSS Support Policy] for critical bugs and security issues.

Major versions will be supported for at least 3 years from the release date (but you must run a supported minor version).

Minor versions will be supported for at least 12 months.

Commercial support is also available from VMware which offers an extended support period.

All Spring Security releases are publicly available from Maven Central and https://repo.spring.io. We do not have a private repository reserved only for paying customers.

### End of Life

Spring Security releases are marked as "end-of-life" when they are no longer supported or released in any form. If you are running an EOL version, you should upgrade as soon as possible.

Spring Security releases are marked end-of-life in one of two ways:

* If they are the last minor to align with a given Spring Framework minor, then they are marked as end-of-life when that Spring Framework minor is marked end-of-life. 
* Otherwise, they are marked as end-of-life when their corresponding Spring Boot minor is marked end-of-life.

Please note that a version can be out of support before it is end-of-life. During this time you should only expect releases for critical bugs or security issues.
