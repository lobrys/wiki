= Spring Security Release Schedule Guidelines

* These are guidelines around when Spring Security will be released.
We favor pragmatism to sticking strictly to the rules.
* Spring Security releases the first Wednesday of the month.
If a release happens over a holiday, then we will do it the following Wed.
* We have two GA releases a year labeled GA-1 and GA-2
* If an RC2 is necessary, we will release RC2 two weeks after RC1
* Regularly scheduled patch releases occur on even months
* There may be circumstances (i.e fixing a CVE) where an extra release is performed.
