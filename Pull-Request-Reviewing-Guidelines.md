We welcome everyone that wants to contribute to Spring Security in some way, either submitting a Pull Request, creating an issue ticket, asking questions, and even reviewing other's Pull Requests. But, to be able to maintain the code standard that Spring Security has, we created this guideline to help you to be aware of what and how to do a code review.

_This document brings recommendations and it's not supposed to be interpreted as a set of rules._
