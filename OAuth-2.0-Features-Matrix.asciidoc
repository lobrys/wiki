The following matrix outlines all the OAuth 2.0 features implemented by the various projects within the Spring portfolio.
The matrix may be used to determine which project(s) to use based on your OAuth 2.0 requirements.

NOTE: Spring Security 5.0 introduced new _Client_ support for the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework and OpenID Connect 1.0.
 The plan is to also provide support for _Resource Server_ and _Authorization Server_ in future releases.
 This matrix will be kept up-to-date as we complete new features.

For additional information, please see the <<frequently-asked-questions,Frequently Asked Questions>>.

[[frequently-asked-questions]]
= Frequently Asked Questions

[qanda]
*What is the future of OAuth 2.0 support in Spring Security?*::
  The next generation of OAuth 2.0 support is currently underway in Spring Security 5,
  as we introduced new _Client_ support for the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework and OpenID Connect Core 1.0.
  The plan is to also provide support for _Resource Server_ and _Authorization Server_ in future releases
  along with more extensive support for https://oauth.net/2/[OAuth 2.0 Core and Extensions^], http://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect 1.0^] and
  http://jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)^].
*Where can I find out more information on which OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0 features will be implemented in Spring Security 5?*::
  You may track upcoming features in the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues[Spring Security GitHub^] repo using the labels
  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/labels/OAuth2[OAuth2^],
  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/labels/OIDC[OIDC^] and
  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/labels/JWT-JOSE[JWT-JOSE^].
*Where can I find samples and documentation for Spring Security 5 OAuth 2.0 support?*::
  Spring Security 5 introduced the new OAuth 2.0 Login feature along with a
  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/tree/5.0.1.RELEASE/samples/boot/oauth2login[sample^] and detailed
  https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.0.1.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#jc-oauth2login[documentation^].
  We will continue to provide samples and documentation as we build out new features.
*Are there new features being implemented in Spring Security OAuth 2.2+?*::
  We are limiting new features in Spring Security OAuth 2.2+ and only providing bug fixes and minor enhancements.
  Our plan going forward is to build all the features currently in Spring Security OAuth into Spring Security 5.x.
  After Spring Security 5.x has reached feature parity with Spring Security OAuth,
  we intend to retire the Spring Security OAuth project.
*Does Spring Boot 2.0 provide support for Spring Security OAuth?*::
  Spring Boot 2.0 has dropped support for Spring Security OAuth.
  However, it provides support for the new OAuth 2.0 Login feature in Spring Security 5.
*Is there a way to integrate Spring Security OAuth in Spring Boot 2.0?*::
  The https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-oauth2-boot[Spring Security OAuth Boot 2 Autoconfig^] project is a port
  of the Spring Security OAuth auto-configuration contained in Spring Boot 1.5.x.
  If you would like to use Spring Security OAuth in Spring Boot 2.0,
  you must explicitly include the following dependency in your project:
  - *groupId:* `org.springframework.security.oauth.boot`
  - *artifactId:* `spring-security-oauth2-autoconfigure`
